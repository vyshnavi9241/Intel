Innovative Monitoring System for TeleICU Patients Using Video Processing and Deep Learning:
YOLO Integration
The integration of YOLO into the TeleICU plays a pivotal role in achieving real-time and accurate object detection within hospital intensive care units. YOLO is a state-of-the-art deep learning algorithm that excels at detecting and classifying objects in images or video frames swiftly and with high precision.

YOLO Training Process
In the root folder, there's a Python notebook named `Train_YOLOv8.ipynb`, which details the YOLO training process.
Real-time Monitoring: Utilizing YOLO for object detection, the system ensures fast and accurate identification of events within ICU rooms.
